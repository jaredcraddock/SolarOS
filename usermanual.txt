II. Overview of SolarOS:
-------------------------
Solar OS is a operating system simulation built on top of OSX.
SolarOS currently supports 8 commands: 
	1. version
	2. date
	3. directory
	4. history
        5. batch
	6. aliasing
	7. exit
	8. help.
        9. createPCB
	10.deletePCB
	11.block
	12.unblock
	13.showPCB
	14.showAll
	15.showReady
	16.showBlocked
	17.generateRandomPCBs
	18.exec
This is currently under rapid development, this manual will be updated frequently.

III. Command Summary:
	version - displays the current version of SolarOS
	date - displays the current date; includes year,month,day,hour,second.
	directory - prints a list of all the files in the directory of SolarOS
	history - prints a history of the commands used in the shell session
	batch -  sequentially runs a script of commands from a .txt file
	aliasing - rename a command to something else; the original cmd still persists aswell.
	exit - exits the program upon user confirmation.
	help - displays the information for each command.
	createPCB -creates a PCB and places it into the ready queue
       deletePCB - deletes a specific PCB (removes it from ready or blocked queue)
       block - blocks a specific process
       unblock - removes a process from blocked queue and inserts it into ready queue
       showPCB - displays all the information about a process
       showAll - shows all the information about every process in every queue
       showReady- shows all the information about every process in the ready queue
       showBlocked - shows all the information about every process in the blocked queue
       generateRandomPCBs - generates a specific number of random processes
       exec - runs every process through the cpu, ends when ready & blocked queue are both empty

IV. Command Explanations:
	date - simply calling "version" will display the current date in the OS

	directory - simply calling "directory" prints a list of all the files in the directory of SolarOS

	history - simply calling "history" will list a history of the commands used in the shell session

	batch - after entering "batch", the user will be asked for the file name. if
		if file name and script are valid, commands will be executed sequentially
		otherwise, an error will be displayed that the file could not be found.

	aliasing - after entering "aliasing", user will be prompted for the new command nickname 
		   of their choice. If a command already exists, it cannot become an alias nickname. Next, 		   the user will be prompted for the base command that they are 
		   renaming.  Aliasing currently supports both the original command name in addition to
		   any extra aliases the command goes by. 	

	exit - after entering "exit", user will be prompted to confirm the exit.
	       if confirmed, the program will exit.

	help - entering "help" will display a list of all commands in SolarOS and their descriptions.

       createPCB - User enters the id of the process, and then the amount of memory of the process.
		    the process is then created and inserted into the ready queue.
                   will give errors if ID is not unique or memory exceeds system memory.

       deletePCB - User enters the id of the process to delete. If it exists, it will be deleted
		    and removed from its state queue. Will give error if ID does not exist.

       block - User enters the id of process to block. Will remove process from ready queue and
 		insert it into the blocked queue. Will give error if ID is invalid.

       unblock - User enters the ID of a process to unblock. Will remove process from blocked queue
                 and insert into the ready queue. Will give error if invalid.

       showPCB - User enters the ID of the process to lookup.
                 displays what state a PCB is in as well as all of its attributes;
  
	showAll - Displays all the attributes of every existing process on the system.

	showReady - displays all the attributes of every process in the ready queue.

	showBlocked - displays all the attributes of every process in the blocked queue.

	generateRandomPCBs -  User inputs how many processes to create and they will be created
				and placed into the ready queue. Possible to have slightly less than anticipated
				if random number generator generates a duplicate ID.

       exec - runs every process on the system through the cpu, ends when ready and blocked queue
		are both empty. Processes may be deleted, reinserted into the ready queue, or blocked to wait for an
		i/o event depending on random number generator.
